# TUTORIAL CREATION

## What is a tutorial

The tutorial of a videogame is the first impression we have about it and a lot of times it can affect the will of keep playing or just quit it because learning how the world of the game we are playing works is boring and slow. Also, the tutorial can be visible or invisible; the first one reminds you that the player is actually playing the videogame, breaking the magic circle and inmersion most of the times, while the second one just introduces the player to the story inmediatly and teaches him the mechanics without specifically explaining them.

### Visible tutorial

Visible tutorials tend to be boring and slow and are usually a must avoid. The techniques which characterize them are:

1. Text boxes (Which pause the game and breaks the gameplay to read sentences).
2. Tutorial area (An area which is designed just for the tutorial that feels out of the game and non responsive of our actions).
3. Detailed explanation (A detailed explanation of almost every mechanic of the game that maybe the player does not use until few hours later, but because the tutorial is just in the beggining, everything must be explained in it).

### Invisible tutorials

Invisible tutorials teaches the player to play without him knowing it. Lots of players prefer to skip tutorials if they have the chance so the invisble tutorial can be more easy-going and practical. These kind of tutorials share the techniques of:

1. Not pausing the game to explain anything but forcing the player to understand hoe the world works.
2. Using non obstrusive and pausing messages durning chill moments so the player can understand what is he leraning.
3. The player being unaware of the ending of the tutorial because it is well merged with the story and gameplay (Good magic circle maintenance)
