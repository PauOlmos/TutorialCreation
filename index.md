# TUTORIAL CREATION

## What is a tutorial

The tutorial of a videogame is the first impression we have about it and a lot of times it can affect the will of keep playing or just quit it because learning how the world of the game we are playing works is boring and slow. Also, the tutorial can be visible or invisible; the first one reminds you that the player is actually playing the videogame, breaking the magic circle and inmersion most of the times, while the second one just introduces the player to the story inmediatly and teaches him the mechanics without specifically explaining them.

### Visible tutorial

Visible tutorials tend to be boring and slow and are usually a must avoid. The techniques which characterize them are:

1. Text boxes (Which pause the game and breaks the gameplay to read sentences).
2. Tutorial area (An area which is designed just for the tutorial that feels out of the game and non responsive of our actions).
3. Detailed explanation (A detailed explanation of almost every mechanic of the game that maybe the player does not use until few hours later, but because the tutorial is just in the beggining, everything must be explained in it).

### Invisible tutorials

Invisible tutorials teaches the player to play without him knowing it. Lots of players prefer to skip tutorials if they have the chance so the invisble tutorial can be more easy-going and practical. These kind of tutorials share the techniques of:

1. Not pausing the game to explain anything but forcing the player to understand hoe the world works.
2. Using non obstrusive and pausing messages durning chill moments so the player can understand what is he leraning.
3. The player being unaware of the ending of the tutorial because it is well merged with the story and gameplay (Good magic circle maintenance)

## First 3 minutes of the game

Understanding the first 3 minutes of the game as the actual first 3 minutes of gameplay, excluding cinematics and character personalization, these are at least, visible or invisible, a game tutorial.

The first 3 minutes of gameplay must be an initiation to the world, overcoming simple and short goals to undesrtand and get used to the mechanics that are presented. Also, the first 3/5 mintues are crutial for the player because it can stock fun and great memories that will meake remember the game with positive emotions.

However, it is not easy to entertain the player the first minutes if he does not know hot to play so there are 10 well stablished rules to follow to ensure a great and fun game tutorial, which are George's rules, explained on his 2012 GDC talk (link on documentation).

1. Blend the tutorial on the game (invisible tutorials).
2. Make the player DO something, not read it. Spending the valuable first minutes of the game reading instructions it is not fun nor memorable.
3. Start giving the player the minimum to play but the necessary to learn through the time is better than trying to impress the player and showingg all the mechanics at the beggining, weighing him down and not being receptive to learn more about the game.
4. "Just get the player to do it once"[Filament Games, explaining George's rules]. Guide the player to do the actions once and not assume that just by explaining it, the player will remember that.
5. Less is more. Using a maximum of eight words to explain what the action is about.
6. Always avoid pop-up texts and by consequence, use hint banners.
7. Use adaptative messaging rather than explicit direction.
8. Make every word of the tutorial text relevant, introducing jokes, storytelling or confusing explanantions can introduce to the player the habit of skipping dialogs.
9. Reinforcing the 5th rule, use as much visuals as possible to reduce the words and the reading time.
10. Finally, avoid explaining and teaching things that everyone knows such as jump on a platform game or shoot on a Call of Duty game, it is useless.

## Lerarning curve analysis

Every game relies on its own learning curve, which is the relation between time spent playing and the loss rate/challanges achieved, and sometimes this curve it is the point of the game; it is not equally fun dying in CoD than in Dark Souls. The average learning curve uses to be something like:

As seen on the image, it is easier to have a growing curve with a tutorial.

Other learning curves:
